# IMDB_Movie_Analysis

In this project, I’m working as a Data Analyst and doing 
project of IMDb movie analysis. The dataset provided is 
related to IMDb Movies which includes 3757 rows 28 
columns after the data cleaning.
In this project we’re doing analysis and investigate about 
What factors influence the success of a movie on IMDb ?
Here, success can be defined by high IMDb ratings. So we 
have to find the valuable insights to better understanding to 
the directors, movie producers, investors what makes a 
movie successful and to make informed decisions in their 
future projects.
The valuable insights will provide the better decision making 
to the directors, movie producers and investors how to create 
successful movies that increase their gross earning from the 
movie and make higher profit. 
From this data, we can see that the higher budgets movies 
tends to higher ratings because they can afford the better 
production quality and vfx which can interact the people. And 
we know the it can also enhance our viewing experience. 
Because we know the viewers are more likely to see and 
more likely to rate a movie which they enjoyed, because we 
know positive experiences lead to positive reviews.
As a Data Analyst, My analysis should aim to provide 
actionable insights that can help stakeholders make informed 
decisions.
